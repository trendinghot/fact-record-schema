# Fact Record Schema (FRS)

The Fact Record Schema (FRS) defines a minimal, deterministic format for recording
facts under uncertainty without interpretation, judgment, or authority.

FRS answers one question only:

**“What was recorded — and what was not?”**

## What This Is

FRS is:
- A schema
- A vocabulary
- A set of structural constraints

## What This Is Not

FRS is **not**:
- A platform
- A ledger
- A database
- A governance system
- A safety framework
- A compliance solution
- A trust guarantee

Using FRS does **not** imply correctness, legality, safety, alignment, or compliance.

## Epistemic Outcomes

FRS permits exactly four outcomes:

- MATCH
- MISMATCH
- UNKNOWN
- ABSTAIN

No other outcomes are defined or allowed.

## Status

FRS v0.1 is intentionally minimal and stable.
